    It's been two years since I took the Data Structures class, and I remember feeling terrified, for two very good reasons:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>I didn't know anything about data structures</li>
    <li>The class was going to be taught with C++</li>
</ol>
<p> 
    But I survived! Was it hard? Heck yeah, but it was also very interesing, and I want to help you out in this journey called Data Structures in C++,
    so I'm starting this series of posts in hopes of that. Also, feel free to ask me anything about this topic!
</p>

<p>
    So let's get started, in this post I'll cover some iconic and easy structures:
    <ul>
        <li>Queues</li>
        <li>Stacks</li>
        <li>Lists</li>
    </ul>
    Something I learned is that the graphic representation is <b>really important</b>, since it gives you some 
    intuition about the structure, so I'm adding some drawing to help with that :blush:
